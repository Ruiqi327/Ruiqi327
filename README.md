## Hi there 👋 I'm Ruiqi!

- 🔭 I am currently a senior at Sichuan University (SCU), majoring in Electronic Information Engineering (EIE).
- 🌱 At the moment I am very interested in numerical calculations, optimization theory and its applications. In particular,
     I look forward to applying the optimization algorithms I have mastered in the field of deep learning. Besides, I also
     have some novel (may be strange) ideas, such as using analog circuits to solve time-varying optimization problems, which
     is actually motivated by practical control problems.
